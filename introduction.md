Prior Experience
------------------

I would describe my experience in the field of data modeling as very low. I had a touchpoint with it in the first semester in a course called "data visualization", but i found it
very hard to take something with me out of that course. This is why i am looking forward to this course even more! 

Whishes on the course
---------------------
  
  I have seen the schedule and think, that there is already a lot in it what i am looking for. I would be very pleased to learn more about the following steps:
 
  1. **Where can i find useful data?**
  
     This might not be a big deal. Just a few hints will be peferct. And of course we know the big sources like open data for e.g..
  3. **How can i make my data work?**
  
       In which form does my data need to be and how can i achieve that?   
    For example if some records are unfullfilled, some data is missing etc. How can I proof, that i can use this data without 
    getting a false result, because something in the data is missing, especially, when i work with very large resources.
  3. **Do the math**
  
       How and what math can i do with my data?  
    We have been working with r in the first semester, which was really hard, 
    as i didn't relly understood, what i was calculating on. Is there any usefull literatur on math for data scientest OR
    do i even need to know all the math or is the program doing it? I am from the data journalism degree course, so 
    my mathematically background is not as huge as the one from the data scientists, even though i had it as my main course 
    in the abitur ;)
  
  
  What else?
  ----------
  Of course i also want to learn more about phyton and github and all the mark-up stuff. As i dont have a clou about it yet, it is hard for me formulate any whishes. I would be very
  pleased to leran more about the correlation between python and data visualization tools and so on.
  We have been working with some tools for data visualization on our web-project allready. We used data wrapper and carto.
